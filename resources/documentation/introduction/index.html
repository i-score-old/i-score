      <p>i-score is an interactive sequencer for intermedia creation. It allows to create flexible and interactive scenarios and is especially designed for live performance, art installation, museography or any context requiring a precise and interactive execution of timed events.</p>
<h3>A sequencer for distributed media systems</h3>
<p>Unlike a number of digital audio or video workstation, i-score does not process media itself. Instead, it works as a remote controller recalling snapshots and automations sent to some distant applications through various protocols such as <a href="http://opensoundcontrol.org">Open Sound Control</a>, Midi or <a href="https://github.com/Minuit/minuit">Minuit</a>. Hence it can easily be used in large setups involving video, audio or light software or hardware. As such, it provides a unified and global solution to control parameters changes in a synchronous or asynchronous way.</p>

<h3>A stratified time organization</h3>
<p>i-score aims at bringing a flexible solution to the managment and execution of events and their evolution in time. Modern DAWs now offer a number of tools to write precise automations along a timeline. However, as powerful as these are in the context of fixed-time media, such solutions are of little help when introducing interactivity in the execution of produced scenarios. On the other hand, a number of softwares allows to trigger events in an interactive way, through a cue-based paradigm. However, these may not offer automation facilities as advanced as those found in modern <span class="caps">DAW</span> and also often rely on a sequential and linear triggering of events.</p>
<p>Hence i-score brings these two approaches in a unified timeline. Scenario writing and execution in i-score thus makes possible to write fixed-timed automations as well as sequences of automations triggered interactively. Most importantly, these two paradigms can be combined and used in parallel or hierarchically and provide the high level of control as well as openess required by today&#8217;s creation.</p>
