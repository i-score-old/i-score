This software is an interactive intermedia sequencer.
It allows the precise and flexible scripting of interactive scenarios.
In contrast to most sequencers, i-score doesn’t produce any media, 
but controls other environments’ parameters, by creating snapshots 
and automations, and organizing them in time in a multi-linear way.
